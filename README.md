# Media 🏄‍♂️

This is our media repository to upload images to S3

## How to work with it

1 - Clone the repo and open a branch

2 - Run your images through a website that reduces size (smaller images mean faster load times) ie: [https://squoosh.app/, https://tinypng.com/]

3 - On [media folder](/media) add your images

4 - Open a PR

After the PR is merged the github action will automatically upload them to S3

(If you are uploading an image to be used on extension, remember to ask the designers if we should add a `@2x` version to guarantee high quality images on product)
