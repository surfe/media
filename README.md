# Media 🏄‍♂️

This is our media repository to upload images to S3

## How to work with it

1 - Clone the repo and open a branch

2 - Run your images through a website that reduces size (smaller images mean faster load times) ie: [https://squoosh.app/, https://tinypng.com/]

3 - On [media folder](/media) add your images

4 - Open a PR

After the PR is merged the github action will automatically upload them to S3
